[WIP] Guide to Infoshift's Values

A shifter lives his/her life firmly around these values.

Noble
"There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self."
A giver, not a taker
Emanates positivity.
Contributes.
Giver of compliments and validation and does not expect it.
Honest
Speak your thoughts. Being "nice" and dishonest will do more harm than good.
If a piece of contribution is bad. Say it.
#1 and #2 Applies. Be in the position where you want your fellow shifter to improve, not where you want to be credited for being a better shifter. There is nothing noble in that.
Has an open-mind
The truth is you don't know everything.
The truth is you are never always correct.
Speaks his/her mind
With good intentions and an open mind, speak what you think.
Your every thought and every knowledge counts. These are valuable.
If you find a video funny, share it with everyone so everyone can share the laughter.
Always learning
There's always something to learn from everyone and everything.
"Everyday is an opportunity to learn something new. Another day to disprove something that I knew."
Embraces randomness
It has been with us since the beginning. Find positivity in it and embrace it.

Guide to Facilitating a Sprint Meeting

A sprint meeting is a meeting where the team discusses which tasks to do in that current sprint. Sprint duration varies between a week to a month. Our standard sprint duration is a week.

Break down tasks into smaller manageable tasks.
Determine task dependencies.
Organize tasks order by the following criteria:
dependencies (tasks with less dependencies should go up)
urgency (tasks needed as soon as possible should go up)
difficulty (tasks easier to implement should go up)
Determine which tasks to do in the current sprint.
