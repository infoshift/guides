[WIP] Guide to Infoshift's Values
----------------------------------

A shifter lives his/her life firmly around these values.

1) Noble
  "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men.
  True nobility lies in being superior to your former self."
  
2) A giver, not a taker
  - Emanates positivity.
  - Contributes.
  - Giver of compliments and validation and does not expect it.
  
3) Honest
  - Speak your thoughts. Being "nice" and dishonest will do more harm than good.
  - If a piece of contribution is bad. Say it.
  - #1 and #2 Applies. Be in the position where you want your fellow shifter to improve,
    not where you want to be credited for being a better shifter. There is nothing noble in that.
  
4) Has an open-mind
  - The truth is you don't know everything.
  - The truth is you are never always correct.
  
5) Speaks his/her mind
  - With good intentions and an open mind, speak what you think.
  - Your every thought and every knowledge counts. These are valuable.
  - If you find a video funny, share it with everyone so everyone can share
    the laughter.
  
6) Always learning
  - There's always something to learn from everyone and everything.
  - "Everyday is an opportunity to learn something new. Another day to disprove something that I knew."
  
7) Embraces randomness
  - It has been with us since the beginning. Find positivity in it and embrace it.
