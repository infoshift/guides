Infoshift Values
================

A shifter lives his/her life firmly around these values.

Noble
^^^^^
"There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self."
A giver, not a taker
Emanates Positivity.

Contributes
^^^^^^^^^^^
Giver of compliments and validation and does not expect it.

Honest
^^^^^^
Speak your thoughts. Being "nice" and dishonest will do more harm than good.
If a piece of contribution is bad. Say it.
#1 and #2 Applies. Be in the position where you want your fellow shifter to improve, not where you want to be credited for being a better shifter. There is nothing noble in that.

Has an open-mind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The truth is you don't know everything.
The truth is you are never always correct.

Speaks his/her mind
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

With good intentions and an open mind, speak what you think.
Your every thought and every knowledge counts. These are valuable.
If you find a video funny, share it with everyone so everyone can share the laughter.

Always learning
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
There's always something to learn from everyone and everything.
"Everyday is an opportunity to learn something new. Another day to disprove something that I knew."

Embraces randomness
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It has been with us since the beginning. Find positivity in it and embrace it.
