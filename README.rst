[WIP] Guide to Infoshift's Values
----------------------------------

A shifter has his/her own core values.

1) Noble
  "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men.
  True nobility lies in being superior to your former self."
  
2) A giver, not a taker
  - Emanates positivity.
  - Contributes.
  - Giver of compliments and validation and does not expect it.
  
3) Honest
  - Speak your thoughts. Being "nice" and dishonest will do more harm than good.
  - If a piece of contribution is bad. Say it.
  - #1 and #2 Applies. Be in the position where you want your fellow shifter to improve,
    not where you want to be credited for being a better shifter. There is nothing noble in that.
  
4) Has an open-mind
  - The truth is you don't know everything.
  - The truth is you are never always correct.
  
5) Speaks his/her mind
  - You, every though, and every knowledge you have are of big value.
  - With good intentions and an open mind, speak what you think.
  - It is a contribution that counts.
  - If you find a video funny, share it with everyone so everyone can share
    the laughter.
  
6) Always Learning
  - There's always something to learn from everyone and everything.
  - "Everyday is an opportunity to learn something new. Another day to disprove something that I knew."

2) Work Anywhere
  - You have the freedom to work anywhere you're comfortable.


Guide to Facilitating a Sprint Meeting
--------------------------------------

A sprint meeting is a meeting where the team discusses which tasks to do in that current sprint.
Sprint duration varies between a week to a month. Our standard sprint duration is a week.

1) Break down tasks into smaller manageable tasks.
2) Determine task dependencies.
3) Organize tasks order by the following criteria:
  - dependencies (tasks with less dependencies should go up)
  - urgency (tasks needed as soon as possible should go up)
  - difficulty (tasks easier to implement should go up)
4) Determine which tasks to do in the current sprint.


Guide to Contributing Code

We have high standards when it comes to craft. At the same time, we make sure
that every piece of contribution counts. Here's how you can contribute to a
project.

1) Fork
2) Code
3) Pull-request
4) Wait for suggestions and comments. Push improvements if needed.
5) You're done. Time to work on the next task.

contributors. Here's how you can effectively manage contributions while keeping
