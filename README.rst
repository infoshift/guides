Guide to Facilitating a Sprint Meeting
--------------------------------------

A sprint meeting is a meeting where the team discusses which tasks to do in that current sprint.
Sprint duration varies between a week to a month. Our standard sprint duration is a week.

1) Break down tasks into smaller manageable tasks.
2) Determine task dependencies.
3) Organize tasks order by the following criteria:
  - dependencies (tasks with less dependencies should go up)
  - urgency (tasks needed as soon as possible should go up)
  - difficulty (tasks easier to implement should go up)
4) Determine which tasks to do in the current sprint.
